<h5>1: what is the difference between Functional components and Class components</h5>
a component in general is a piece of code that serves a specific purpose in terms of functionality and visual aspect and if merged with other components we can build the whole app. A functional component is a function that accepts variables(props) and defines that component by returning JSX-format code. A class component is a feature that we often use in ES6 based on object oriented programming principles to define a react component and renturning by using the render method.

We can use hooks only in a function that defines a react component, and before any returning statement.

the variable that a functional react component accepts and that we assign properties and value to it under the governance of a parent-child relation and it's unidirectional(parent-> child).
